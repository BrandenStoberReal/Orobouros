# The Orobouros Framework
Orobouros is a C# framework for scraping the web. Many attempts to do this have been created in various languages, but a different approach is taken with Orobouros due to the patented OrobourosModuleâ„¢ system that allows any person to write their own plugin for any website.

# Installation
Orobouros is available [as a NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Orobouros) and from the ``Github Actions`` page. Keep in mind the pre-compiled builds on GitHub do not include dependencies. If you prefer the .NET CLI, you can also simply run:

```
dotnet add package Orobouros
```

On its own, Orobouros does nothing and needs modules to function.

# Building
If you insist on compiling this yourself, all you need is ``.NET 8 Core``. I would not recommend taking advantage of the tests, as they require specific configurations I use in debugging.

# Development
Take a look at the TestModule project included in this repo to get a general idea on how to use this framework. XML annotations are also provided. At some point I will create a wiki with relevant information, but for now the core functionality takes priority. Obfuscated code is allowed (as in the framework won't refuse to execute it) but incredibly discouraged due to malware concerns. If you really feel the need to keep your source code hidden, just don't share your module.

Example code to submit a scrape request to the loaded module stack:
```csharp
ScrapingManager.InitializeModules(); // Only call this once at the entry point of your application
List<ModuleContent> requestedInfo = new List<ModuleContent> { ModuleContent.Text }; // Content you want to request from the modules. How this is handled is entirely dependent on the module's developer.
ModuleData? data = ScrapingManager.ScrapeURL("https://www.test.com/posts/posthere", requestedInfo); // Perform scrape request and wait for the returned data.
ScrapingManager.FlushSupplementaryMethods(); // Stop background methods. This should be called at least once when the application is exiting.
```

Example code to return a simple line of text from a module's scrape method:
```csharp
ModuleData data = new ModuleData();
ProcessedScrapeData exampleInstance = new ProcessedScrapeData(ModuleContent.Text, parameters.URL, "Hello World!");
data.Content.Add(exampleInstance);
return data;
```

Please consult the XML documentation or the TestModule project for further code examples.
